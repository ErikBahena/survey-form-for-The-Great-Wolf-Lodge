Hello to whoever is reading this. This is my third project, I'm modeling a survey form for an entertainment facility called The Great Wolf Lodge. This project will demonstrate the following skills:

1.Basic understanding and execution of HTML and CSS.

2.Creating a repository on GitHub for this site.

3.Creating a folder structure to support the web page.

4.Linking the HTML and CSS files together using link attributes.

5.Adding the HTML content of: title bar, sub-title, labels, text forms with form validations, radio buttons, checkboxes, text-areas, and a button.

6.CSS styling such as: borders and thier corresponding radiuses. Font families and font sizes. Flex display columns with centered positioning and proper responsiveness. Removing default focus attributes and color matching the companies logo.

7.Commiting and pushing current progress to GitHub.
